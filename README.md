# Forest understory reflectance algorithm for airborne hyperspectral remote sensing applications

This repository is used to store all scripts used for the understory PhD publications. The goal of this algorithm is to estimate forest floor reflectance as a function of site fertility using airborne reflectance data.

The scrips were written in the R programming language. 


The results can be found in the following publications:

1) Spectral Similarity and PRI Variations for a Boreal Forest Stand Using Multi-angular Airborne Imagery 
Published in journal Remote Sensing.

2) Estimation of boreal forest floor reflectance from airborne hyperspectral data (Under revision)
Currently under revision for journal of Remote sensing of Environment.
